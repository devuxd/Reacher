/**
 * This class is not to be used in new Crystal analyses and is kept for

 * A LatticeElement embodies the analysis knowledge at a particular point in the
 * program.
 * {@link LatticeElementOps} allows using classes implementing this interface
 * in a Crystal flow analysis.  
 * 
 * For simple lattices, this interface may be sufficient.
 * This interface is in particular useful for lattices which have
 * a fixed number of elements in them.
 * More sophisticated lattices are probably easier to implement using
 * {@link edu.cmu.cs.crystal.flow.ILatticeOperations} directly. 
 * Furthermore, lattices based on existing datatypes such as {@link java.util.Set}
 * are more easily implemented with {@link edu.cmu.cs.crystal.flow.ILatticeOperations}.
