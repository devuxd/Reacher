/**
 * Analysis writers do not implement this interface directly; instead, they implement
 * an extending interface that instantiates the node type parameter, <code>N</code> of
 * this interface.
 * This interface allows implementing a worklist algorithm independently from the type
 * of node being transferred over.
 * Implementers of flow analyses over concrete node types should create a sub-interface
 * that instantiates the node type parameter.  
 * {@link ILatticeOperations} is such a sub-interface for flow analyses over Eclise AST nodes.
 * {@link edu.cmu.cs.crystal.flow.worklist.WorklistTemplate} can be used as the basis for 
 * flow analyses over other kinds of nodes.
 * @param <LE> Analysis information being tracked.
 * @param <N> Nodes our lattice information is computed over
