/**
 * Implement this interface to provide typical lattice operations.
 * Instances of this interface are used by Crystal flow analyses to compare
 * and join analysis-specific information.
 * This interface is parameterized by the type used to represent values in
 * the lattice.
 * Notice that there are no assumptions being made about the lattice values,
 * which allows using existing types such as {@link java.util.Set}.
 * Crystal encourages including analysis-specific operations into classes
 * implementing this interfaces, but this is not required.
 * 
 * Lattices are defined with four methods:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #bottom()} represents the most precise lattice value.  (There is
 * no direct way of acquiring Top.)
 * <li>{@link #atLeastAsPrecise(Object, Object, ASTNode)} compares two lattice values.
 * <li>{@link #join(Object, Object, ASTNode)} approximates two lattice values
 * by one that is less precise than both given.
 * <li>{@link #copy(Object)} duplicates a lattice value.  This is an implementation
 * device that is needed because flow analyses derive lattice values for new program
 * points from lattice values for program points that were already analyzed.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * @param <LE> Analysis information being tracked.
