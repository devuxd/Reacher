 * This class is the abstract super type of all variables in the three address

 * the different types of variables have is that they all have a type.
 * 
 * There are several different variable types that extend this type and in
 * general are much more interesting than this class. These subclasses include
 * 'temporary' variables in three address code as well as variables that
 * correspond with actual Java source code variables.
