/**
 * <p>Instruction representing the "has next" test at the top of a Java 5 enhanced <b>for</b>
 * loop.</p>
 * 
 * <code>
 * List<String> strings = ...;
 * for(String s : strings) ...;
 * </code>
 * 
 * <p>Every iteration of an extended <b>for</b> loop such as the one above
 * begins with an implicit test whether
 * the iterated-over {@link java.lang.Iterable} has another element.
 * This implicit test is represented with this instruction.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Notice that the expression that evaluates to the iterated-over 
 * is <i>not</i> represented here and instead is
 * represented with separate instructions.  However, {@link #getIteratedOperand()}
 * returns the variable representing the result of that evaluation.  (This
 * arrangement models that the evaluation of the iterated-over Iterable
 * is not part of the loop.)</p>
 * 
 * <p>The local variable being declared as also not represented with this instruction
 * and instead is represented with a separate {@link SourceVariableDeclaration}.
 * (This latter choice models that the declared variable is only available inside the loop.)</p>
 * 
 * <p>We chose to preserve enhanced <b>for</b> loops with this instruction instead
 * of desugaring it into a regular <b>for</b> loop over a {@link java.util.Iterator}
 * for practical reasons (the Eclipse AST does not do this) and to allow analyses
 * to benefit from the stylized iteration that encoded with enhanced <b>for</b> that,
 * e.g., does not permit modifications to the iterated-over {@link java.lang.Iterable}.</p>
