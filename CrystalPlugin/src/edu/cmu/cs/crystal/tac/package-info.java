/**
 * This package contains classes and interfaces for writing flow analyses
 * based on three-address code (TAC).
 * If you are writing a flow analysis, you may find
 * TAC easier to use that the Eclipse AST. 
 * TAC has no sub-expressions and uses temporary variables to break up
 * complex expressions in the AST into simpler expressions.
 * 
 * To create a flow analysis using TAC, 
 * implement either {@link edu.cmu.cs.crystal.tac.ITACTransferFunction} or 
 * {@link edu.cmu.cs.crystal.tac.ITACBranchSensitiveTransferFunction}.
