We have an abstract trace tree that we have to construct a mapping to Nodes for which will then be mapped to VisualItems. 
We basically need to have something that creates a node for every abstract trace item. And there needs to be some way to figure out
from the node what the underlying abstract trace item is for asking queries about what things exist.
